  <meta name="description" content="Hi, welcome to my site. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; I graduated from the Wharton Business School of the [University of Pennsylvania](/) with a Bachelor of Science in Economics in 2015. The bachelor’s programme was very much focused on applying economic theory to real-world problems. Therefore, I decided to continue my education with a **Master of Science in Economic Theory and Policy at the Levy Economics Institute**, to get a better theoretical foundation. Following my graduation in 2016, I started working in a non-profit organisation focusing on equal income distribution as a research officer. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br&gt; I enjoy my work as an applied researcher at my current job, where I provide data and knowledge for the organisation’s advocacy programme. However, I have been increasingly wondering to what extent existing economic theory captures the lived realities of people affected by unequal income distribution. When I came across the open PhD position, I knew that this would be a great opportunity to engage with this topic on a more theoretical level, and to make sense of my daily observations." />
